You covered a great deal of material this week! You went from
learning about the fundamentals of Internet gaming to writing
your own animated spider simulator in Java. Let's take a look
at exactly what you learned so that you can prepare for next week's
lesson.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On your first day as an aspiring Java game programmer, you learned
about the current status of games on the Internet. You saw some
neat Web sites for trying out Internet games, but more importantly,
you saw how great the appeal is for Internet games. Hopefully,
you also saw how great the opportunity is for game designers and
programmers to move games to the Internet.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On Day 2, you learned about Java and how its advanced features
impact game programming. Although Java is still in its infancy
in many ways, it is very clear that the groundwork already exists
for creating compelling Internet games. You learned that the Java
language and runtime system are ideally suited for the needs of
the next generation of globally networked games.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's hard to talk about Java without mentioning object-oriented
programming. Day 3 presented a discussion of object-oriented programming
concepts and how they are implemented in the Java language. This
discussion of OOP wasn't meant as a rehash of standard Java knowledge;
rather, it was presented to serve as the conceptual backbone for
much of the code design throughout the book. This lesson provides
the background on OOP techniques that are a necessity in Java
game development.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Day 4's lesson focused on graphics and how they are used in games.
You learned about graphical images and the formats supported by
Java. You also learned about a variety of graphics tools and utilities,
as well as how to create, edit, and find graphics for games on
<BR>
the Web.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Day 5 marked your first foray into Java game programming. Although
you didn't actually create a game, you started looking at code
and getting more technical with some of the aspects of Java that
are important for games. You learned how to work with Java graphics
primitives and graphical images in the GIF image format. You also
learned about the Media Tracker and how it is used to track images
being transferred across an Internet connection.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Day 6's lesson presented the most crucial Java game programming
information for the entire book-sprite animation. At the heart
of most of the games throughout the book lies the sprite animation
engine, which you developed entirely in this lesson. You began
by learning some background on what animation is, along with the
various types of animation and how they are used. You then implemented
a set of Java sprite animation classes, along with a test applet
called Atoms.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What better way to finish off your first week of Java game programming
than with an animated spider simulator? Day 7 presented you with
the development of a complete applet, Sim Tarantula, showing off
more advanced uses of the sprite animation classes. Sim Tarantula
is about as close as you can get to writing a complete game without
actually doing so. After this lesson, you are definitely ready
to move on to writing some real games. Don't worry, because next
week's lesson wastes little time getting you ready for a full-featured
game!

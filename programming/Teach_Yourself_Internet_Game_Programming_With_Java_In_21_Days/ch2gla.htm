If you thought you learned a lot last week, buckle up because
this week you learn a great deal more about Java game programming,
including the development of two complete sample games. You begin
with a conceptual look at user input and its role in gaming, followed
by the Java specifics of handling user input. You then move on
to developing your first complete Java game-Traveling Gecko. You
follow this game by learning the basics of sound and the Java
support for sound. With sound fresh on your mind, you develop
your second complete game-Scorpion Roundup. You finish the week
by taking a look at some techniques for debugging Java games.

If you've made it this far, you're probably feeling pretty good
about your Java game programming skills. You might even wonder
how much could be left to learn. Well, I don't mean to dampen
your spirits, but you still have a decent amount of stuff to cover.
You have yet to touch on artificial intelligence or multiplayer
network gaming, which are two very big topics. You begin your
final week with a conceptual lesson on artificial intelligence,
followed by a complete game utilizing AI-Connect4. You then learn
about the basics of multiplayer games, along with the network
support provided by Java. You combine this knowledge to create
a two- player network version of Connect4-NetConnect4. You finish
the week with lessons on Java code optimization and assembling
a set of Java game development tools.
